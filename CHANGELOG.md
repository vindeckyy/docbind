- Markdown anchors for inline code, headings, tables, fenced code, signature fences, and explicit references.
- Binding lock, three-way diff, tombstones, and rename and move inference.
- Contract shapes for parameters, return types, members, enums, receivers, async, unsafe, and deprecation.
- Compatibility lattice that keeps additive changes silent.
- CLI commands: `init`, `check`, `lock`, `fix`, `explain`, `stats`.
